# GYM Trainer

This Python project leverages OpenCV, Streamlit, and other libraries listed in requirements.txt to create a real-time exercise repetition counter. The application captures video input from your camera, processes it using OpenCV mediapipe to detect and visualize body poses, and then utilizes a custom algorithm to count the number of exercise repetitions performed.
